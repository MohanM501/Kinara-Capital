The objective of this test assignment is to develop a grid system with filtering functionality in the backend. The grid system is designed to display student details (ID, name, total marks, etc.) and allow filtering based on various columns. The assignment involves developing the backend APIs responsible for loading student details with pagination and implementing server-side filtering.
